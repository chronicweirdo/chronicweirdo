    <h2>Communication breakdown and entropy</h2>
    <p>2013.04.10 12.58.00</p>
    <p>The breakdown of communication through successive adoption of simpler and less expressive forms, like "sharing", "liking", "+1ing" and "retweeting", is inevitable since these simpler forms have a greater entropy than articulate messages (they require less energy to be maintained) and, according to the second law of thermodynamics, they are more likely to occur.</p>
